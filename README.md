  - This React project has multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in, and sign up.

  - I used compound components (just a design pattern) to build my components, and there's over 10 examples as to how these are used. 
  - The styling is all handled via styled components. 
  - Using compound components made my actual dumb components really easy to test.
  -  I built this app using React and uses Styled Components for all the styling
  -  .Fuse.js for live search,
